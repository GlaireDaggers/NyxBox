# NyxBox

An emulator for a hypothetical Y2K-era game console, with a feature set directly inspired by my fantasy console DreamBox.

Unlike DreamBox, NyxBox is designed from a much lower level "hardware perspective" - rather than simply acting as a host for a WASM binary, NyxBox attempts to emulate an actual hypothetical machine with a specific hardware specification. The goals are 1.) to be a machine which feels at least roughly period-accurate to what could have been done at the time, and 2.) to provide a specification which could, at least hypothetically, be actually implemented in FPGA with unlimited resources.

This repository is EXTREMELY wip - basically, none of this actually does anything interesting yet. Stay tuned.
